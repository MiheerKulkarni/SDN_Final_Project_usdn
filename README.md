# SDN_final_Project_usdn
For this project I am finding QoS parameters for usdn on cooja simulator. Please navigate to folder usdn and read the readme file about installing contiki and compiler for MSP430
I have also kept my test simulator file 'usdn-test.csc' for testing energy results. The log files should be generated after you run the simulation for 3mins in excel format. Then 
use my python script to run over logfile.xls to see energy, RTT and delay for usdn. Some values I couldn't parse so I had to hard code them.
